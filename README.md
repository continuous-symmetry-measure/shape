## About 

This code was originally developed by Prof. David Avnir and Prof. Mark Pinsky at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 
The code calculates the degree of a general reference shape in a studied shape, and particularly the degree of a given ideal polyhedral shape, in a distorted polyhedron. The continuous shape measure coincides with the continuous symmetry measure for the Platonic polyhedra which are composed of the minimal number of vertices which defines it.

## Usage

shape input_file case_flag [ref_shape if case_flag is 0] permute_flag [perms_file if permute_flag is 2]  [allow_improper]

### Input Parameters:
* **input_file** - The molecular structure  
* **case_flag** - The shape to compare to (0 for a user defined reference shape)  
* **ref_shape** (optional) - The reference shape - only if case_flag = 0  
* **permute_flag** -   
  * 0 for enumeration on all permutations  
  * 1 for identity perm only  
  * 2 for enumeration on permutations in a given permutation file  
* **perms_file** (optional) - A permutations file, only valid if permute_flag = 2.  
The file is of the format: num_permutations + a list of permutations  
The permutations are performed on the reference shape (ref_shape)  
* **allow_improper** (optional) -   
  * 0 - doesn't allow improper rotations (default)   
  * 1 - allow improper rotations
